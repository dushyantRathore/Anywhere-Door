# VisionAR

Immersive AR experiences portal


## Planning without experiences

* AR, can be used to provide immersive experiences of things which are practically impossible
for us to experience. Take for example, picking up your next travel destination by stepping
into the scenes of many countries.

* Our solution not only solves the problem of “planning without experiences”, but it also
provides a “just in time” (or on-the-fly) portal access to any part of the world. Let’s say our
friend missed this wonderful event, and wants to attend the pitch, he can travel seamlessly
across multiple dimensions of the space to experience the place, And just to prove all this
can happen “just-in-time”, let’s see this pitch, live!

* Our object recognition part of solution lets you get the details about the environment, which
provides grounds for contextual and highly targeted advertising. Let’s see what’s up in room
next to us, it’s a live IPL match streaming, with the ads of sponsors and context-specific services,
like EazyDiner.

So overall, in fancy words visionAR distorts “space time continuum” and in simple terms,
it’s a B2B platform that builds just-in-time immersive AR experience, and provides contextual
advertising based on the environment user belongs to.
